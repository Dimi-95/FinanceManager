# FinanceManager
A finance manager that will help achieve a certain financial goal. This is done by running an algorithm that is written to calculate the best possible way of action, regarding spending and saving, so that the user can put money aside, without limiting himself too much (this can be changed, as the program will contain modes. This will vary from normal saving to aggressive saving )


-- PAUSED -- 

The production of this was pasused due to the fact that the Finance Manager, and the way it is supposed to function, works better without C++. 
Since the purpose of these projects is to get better at C++, I am pausing this one.
